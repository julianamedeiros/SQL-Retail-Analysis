## The Dataset
This dataset contains **sales simulations** for 2 years of a multinational fashion retail company, covering global sales transactions.

The data was downloaded via the API from: [Kaggle - Global Fashion Retail Stores Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ricgomes/global-fashion-retail-stores-dataset/data?select=customers.csv)

## Technologies Used:
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management and SQL querying
- **SQL**: Used for data manipulation and analysis
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and reporting

## Project Goal:
The primary objective of this project is to **analyze two years of transaction data** for a global fashion retail company. The goal is to provide actionable insights that will help **optimize sales and marketing strategies** for the upcoming year, with a focus on improving sales performance, understanding customer behavior, and identifying areas of improvement.

## Stakeholder and Business Context
The **Manager of Portuguese Stores** is the main stakeholder for this project. The goal is to support their decision-making by providing **data-driven insights** on:

2. **Customer Behavior**:
    - Who are our top buyers?
    - What is the **average order value (AOV)** of customers?
    - Are return rates higher for certain age groups?


## Data Visualization
To effectively present the insights from the analysis, a **Power BI report** was built to help the stakeholder make informed decisions. The report is designed to be **simple**, **intuitive**, and **direct**, with visualizations that specifically address the key BI questions. 

The following components are included in the report:
- **Revenue trends** over time (yearly, monthly).
- **Top-performing products** by category and subcategory.
- **Profit margins** across categories and subcategories.
- **Customer behavior analysis**, including top buyers and return rates.
- **Regional performance**, highlighting stores or areas that need attention.

The goal is for the report to provide actionable insights at a glance, allowing the stakeholder to easily identify trends and make decisions based on the visualized data.
